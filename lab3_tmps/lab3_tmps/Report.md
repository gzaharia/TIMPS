## TIMPS Laboratory Work Nr.3


### Prerequisites:
  - Design patterns
  - Behavioral design patterns
  - Organize and structure the application using behavioral design patterns.

### Objectives:
  - Study behavioral design patterns
  - Develop a project using 5 behavioral design patterns
  - Ensure connection between patterns
 
 ### Tasks: 
 -  Create an application using 5 design behavioral patterns : 
    - Template
    - Strategy
    - Visitor
    - Iterator
    - Chain 
    
 ### Implementation of task: 
 For performing this laboratory work I have read about behavioral design patterns and what is the purpose of using this patterns. Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.  Behavioral patternsdescribe not just patterns of objects or classes but also the patternsof communication between them. These patterns characterize complex control flow that's difficult to follow at run-time.They shift yourfocus away from flow of control to let you concentrate just on
the wayobjects are interconnected.
